Custom CSS and UI enhancements for Homepage dashboard (gethomepage.dev) -- designed to improve usability and visibility, via slight visual tweaks.

# Homepage Customizations

This repo contains my personal CSS configuration tweak for [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev) â€” a modern, lightweight dashboard for self-hosted services.

Over the years, my dashboard has evolved alongside my infrastructure and skills. These customizations reflect both form and function: minimal design choices, improved visual hierarchy, and better usability for monitoring a growing homelab.
